# Hello World!

This is the beginning of [the GitMate blog](http://blog.gitmate.io).

I have the pleasure of posting this from our very first (temporary, not really
ours) office! We will work hard to make GitMate reality.

With this blog, we will keep you updated over what happened so far, what
happens now and what will happen in the future with our startup - so stay tuned!

If you're curious to meet us: we'll be at the
[coala stand](https://fosdem.org/2017/stands/) at FOSDEM.
